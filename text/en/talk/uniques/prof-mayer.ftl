  Are you an adventurer? It's just as well I met you.
  I'd like to ask you to do something.

  There are many ruins of an ancient civilization on this continent. I have been researching the culture, technology and history of the ancient civilizations from the ruins. 
  However, the analysis of the artifacts alone takes a lot of time, and I don't have enough time to visit the ruins.

  So, I want you to obtain an item "ancient box" at the ruins adn bring it back to me. It contains information about the ancient civilization. If you bring it back to me, I will pay you a reasonable reward.
  Could you undertake this request?

  Great!
  Usually, "ancient box" can be found in the deepest floor of ruins. Visit Adventurers Guild's informant to get the location of ruins.

  Come back anytime you change your mind.

  Good luck.

  Oh, you bring "ancient box" to me!
  Thank you. My research will advance.
  In return, I'll give you an deed of land, and some tools. They will be useful to build your home.
  
  I will give you some rewards for "ancient box" if you bring it to me. Please remember.

  Thank you. This is the reward.
